# Melbourne-Housing-Market
In this project, we analysed real-life data of properties sold in Melbourne, Australia, using Python. We aimed to train a model that will be able to predict the sell price by using most available attributes as an input. The first phase focused on exploratory data analysis that was performed on the model to feel the data, see correlations between the variables and to identify issues and abnormalities in the data. Then, the pre-processing phase prepared the data for modeling, in which we capitalized the prices to one period, in order to nullify the change of currency value affect. Also, linearity assumptions were tested and addressed when needed. The models that were tested are Linear Regression, LASSO regression, Random Forest, CatBoost and Artificial Neural Networks. Our metric for evaluation and comparison is the Mean Absolute Error, which can give proportions to the goodness of the model while also be a metric to compare with other models. We have found wide difference of score between the models. The best model found is CatBoost. The results are showing that it is a difficult task to accurately predict the price, as the mean of the error for the best model is approximately 200K.
